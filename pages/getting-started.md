# Getting Started

Although I do my best to explain the Rust concepts used throughout this guide, if you find yourself struggling (or just looking to learn more) you should look to [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). One of the great things about Rust is it's wealth of documentation/information. Having everything about the language compiled into one easy to read book is very helpful, and is actually the primary way I learned Rust myself. Also it's good to note that all Rust crates (libraries/dependencies) have their own built in documentation that's automatically generated from types and comments and such. The easiest way to pull this up without installing the crate locally is through [https://docs.rs/](https://docs.rs/). For example [here](https://docs.rs/ash/latest/ash/)'s the documentation for [ash](https://crates.io/crates/ash) which is the crate we'll be using to interact with the Vulkan SDK. It's essentially a wrapper over the C/C++ SDK allowing it to be easily used in Rust.
